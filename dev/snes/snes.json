Other squares on the board lead to various events that change the player's status or help\/hinder them in other ways.\n\nYokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi Bangi is based on manga artist Mitsuteru Yokoyama's acclaimed historical manga that retells the Romance of the Three Kingdoms story.

It was produced by Catapult Entertainment, a Cupertino, California-based software company. It is the only modem released in America to have been officially licensed by Nintendo. It debuted in various areas of the United States in late 1994 and 1995.\n\nHistory:\n\nThe Genesis version of the XBAND was released in November 1994, with the Super NES version following in June 1995, and the Super Famicom version in April 1996. The Genesis version also works with the Genesis Nomad. In Brazil the Mega Drive service was released as the Mega Net 2, named after the Sega Meganet.\n\nIn 1995, Catapult Entertainment signed a deal with General Instrument, producers of the Sega Channel, which stipulated that the XBAND modem would henceforth be built into new Sega Channel adapters, and that the top 5 to 10 games offered by Sega Channel each month would be wired for play over XBAND.\n\nInitially, Catapult Entertainment had a limited staff and virtually no advertising. By January 1997, XBAND network playability had reached practically every metropolitan area and several rural areas in the U.S. The actual XBAND modems were carried by a handful of software and video rental chains across the United States. Internationally, the XBAND saw some limited expansion in the Japanese market, and Catapult was working on PC- and Sega Saturn-based versions of the platform, though they merged with Mpath Interactive, and the focus shifted to the online PC gaming service, Mplayer.com (Mplayer.com was taken offline and integrated into GameSpy Arcade in 2001, after acquired by GameSpy on December 2000).\n\nService:\n\nThe concept of playing online was fairly new at the time. Arcades were still quite popular, and online gaming was not yet a household idea.\n\nThe XBAND modem was widely available at Blockbuster Video branches during its time. It retailed for $19.99, with additional charges based on usage. Two pricing plans were available. One had a monthly fee of $4.95 and allowed the user to connect to the service up to 50 times a month with each additional connection costing 15 cents. The other had a monthly fee of $9.95 and granted the subscriber an unlimited number of connections per month. Activities that consumed a player's monthly allowance of connections included dialing into the XBAND service for matchmaking, downloading mail (called \"XMAIL\"), and downloading the daily edition of the two XBAND newsletters, one containing generic news and the other containing platform-specific information such as leaderboards and contest announcements. Players were also assessed a fee of $3.95\/hour for connecting to opponents outside their local calling area; player-to-player connections inside their local calling area were free.\n\nThe modem features built-in storage for up to four users (\"codenames\"). It stores user friend lists, which can contain the codenames of up to ten of the user's friends; the users' XMAIL boxes, storing up to ten incoming and ten outgoing messages for each user; the users' rankings, win\/loss records, and accumulated scores; a short profile section; and the user's avatar (chosen from 40 preset avatars). Text entry is done either through an on-screen keyboard or an optional XBAND keyboard add-on ($29.95 MSRP) released later in the network's lifespan.\n\nThe client-side system worked by manipulating the game's memory in a way similar to Game Genie and third-party computer game modifications such as Multi Theft Auto.\n\nA problem of most online services of the time was that the connection would be lost whenever a phone on the same line was picked up. The XBand operating system was designed to ensure that connections are not lost due to phone activity; in the case of call waiting, the system would alert the user to the call and allow the game to be resumed.\n\nXBAND had an official website where a member could check any other player's statistics, along with other information and updates that were not available to view on consoles.\n\nAt its height, XBAND had 15,000 subscribed members.\n\nGaming:\n\nA 1995 article in Next Generation stated that the XBAND modem's \"ultra-low latency is the key to its successful handling of realtime videogaming\". The modem's data transfer rate was 2,400 bits per second, which, while low compared to PC modems of the time, was sufficient to handle the simple one-on-one games which XBAND was used with.\n\nWhen connecting to play, unless a player specified a particular user from their friend list, players would be matched with a random player elsewhere in the country (or the player's local area code depending on their preference settings) who was also connecting to play the same game. The server would attempt to match players of like skill levels, using the Elo rating system. When the network matched two players up, the newly-connected player's XBAND modem would disconnect from the server and dial the other player, whose own XBAND modem would answer when the phone rang. At that point the players would see the XBAND logo slide together, followed by the matchup screen, which displayed each player's codenames, avatars, locations, and a pre-typed \"taunt\".\n\nIn December 1995 XBAND launched its first national tournament. This was the first modem to modem tournament ever to be held over a console. The grand prize winner received a special Genghis Khan icon for their XBAND profile and a $200 cash prize from Catapult. Peter Kappes aka \"SphiNX\" of Orlando, FL became the first person in history to win a modem to modem national tournament over a console."},{"Name":"Xardion","Platform":"Chou Kou Gasshin Sādion","Release Date":"March 20, 1992","Game Type":"Released","Developer":"Jorudan","Genres":"Action","Description":"The Legend of Xardion comes to life in this Super Nintendo Mega hit.

Turrican's sprite was changed into a marine and several other substitutions were made.

The playing character is an abundant-beaked bird resembling a penguin, named Hakkun, that is able to walk and jump but not to fly. The Rainbow of Happiness shined in the sky above Peaceful Islands: one day it broke apart and now Hakkun has to track down, collect, and put together all rainbow crystals to relive it. The gameplay hinges upon two elements: blocks and potions, the latter of several colours. Hakku makes its way through levels by changing the position of blocks — that will be done by swallowing them to release them on an other place then — and sucking potions — that are to be injected to blocks by the beak, endowing them with new properties consequential to the colour of the fluid — from jars. A level is cleared when the rainbow shards in it are collected. Neither a time limit nor enemy characters are there impeding Hakkun's way. Equally distinctive is the score system: a set number of points is given at the beginning of each level, and a decrease happens with any move made, thus rewarding the player for completing levels with as little moves as possible.\n\nBefore reaching the format of a common Super Famicom cartridge, the game was released for and downloadable by the console's add-on Satellaview in four versions.

By comparison of the graphics, I would not be surprised if Sunsoft intended to simply port the Genesis version to the SNES, although the screenshot in the preview below doesn't appear to correspond to any place in the Genesis version. The SNES was finally graced with a Superman title with the release of The Death and Return of Superman. Perhaps the SNES game was cancelled because it would have come too close to the release of that game. Another possibility is that the SNES version of Superman eventually became The Death and Return of Superman, but that would be pure speculation (it came out in mid-1994).\nA simple demo of Superman was discovered in 2019. It is completely unplayable, and shows Superman flying through an alien landscape. I do not think this kind of scenery exists in the Genesis version.

However, the main aim of the hack is to be as close to vanilla Super Metroid in difficulty as possible!\n\nThere is one new move you need to learn to beat the game: Which is mid air morphing.

Super Mario World Central Production 2, or SMWCP2, for short... I have a lot to say about this collab hack.\n\nI've been watching the progress of this collab since I was 11-12 years old, when I was just a freshman of SMW Central and I was too young to fully contribute to anything. I ended up getting banned as a result of my oblivious stupidity and unhelpful attitude, until years later when I ended up creating the World 3 and 9 maps, as nobody else would rise up to it at the time. Since then, SMWCP2 was seemingly about to be wrapped up with its new-fangled ASM cutscenes and credits around 2013-2014...and it never happened. And even worse, after Blind Devil playtested the hack, it turned out the collaboration was a buggy, glitchy, less-than-appealing mess that was outdated a few years after it came out, what with newer versions of Lunar Magic and other tools coming out with new features and less space-heavy insertions.\n\nAnd so, for the longest of time, SMWCP2 was dead... Until recently, that is! Blind Devil took it upon himself to revise SMWCP2 into the hack it should be: A clean, polished, and ambitious yet fun collab to play. His operation started off slowly, until one day when I decided to make that one post where I sparked interest in revising the project after years of radio silence. And for years, Blind Devil and I searched for people who were interested in revising levels, music, graphics, ASM, anything we could change, we changed it.\n\nThat leads us to today. While Blind Devil has left the site and the project due to real life issues, leaving me and Disk Poppy to take the lead, development has slowed down until a few months ago. Unfortunately, there are some missing features that we want to insert at some point, but we either didn't insert them due to time constraints, or didn't have any space left in the 4MB ROM to insert them. We would need to expand the ROM to 6MB, but that requires the usage of an SA-1 ROM, and unfortunately said ROM is incompatibible with some of SMWCP2's patches. If you think you can help us with that obstacle as well as to help us with anything else we want to add or change, we would appreciate that.\n\nFor anyone curious on what these missing features we wish to add later or what features we wish to change are, here is a list:\n\nList of stuff we want to add\/change in future versions: Show\n\nBut anyway, for what we have, I think we did a great job polishing this hack to try to make it truly shine. Some people might be happy that we took our time and didn't rush out this collab just to be done with it. Other people might say we're polishing a turd. But whatever the case, we're just happy to have the first official release of this long-overdue project done. We will be adding some of these missing features as we go on, hoping that we can reach the potential that SMWCP2 was reaching back in its 2012 years.\n\nOverall though, if this project was meant to be a learning experience to us all, I think it taught us many important lessons when it comes to Super Mario World ROMhacking, but I believe these three are the most important:\n\n1: It's great to be ambitious, but you gotta know your limits. ROMs don't have infinite space to fit all your crazy ideas. Your idea might also be incompatible with another idea you had, so you have to be careful. The SA-1 patch can be full of incompatibilities that you have to watch out for.\n\n2: Sometimes, less is more. Despite what many might have you believe, short ROMhacks aren't the antithesis of a good or amazing hack. Just look at Mario's Mystery Meat, for example. That hack is very short, only lasting people about an hour or two of gameplay depending on how long it takes when they beat it. Yet that hack is filled to the brim with hilarious Vinesauce memes and inside jokes, which makes it a treat playing. Holding back on the amount of levels or content overall a hack could have means you could squeeze in some space for something very space-heavy.\n\n3: And I believe that this is the bigbest and most important lesson of them all..."},{"Name":"Super Mario World: Central Production","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","Release Date":"December 12, 2010","Game Type":"ROM Hack","Genres":"Platform","Description":"The first ever collaboration hack created by over 200 users of SMW Central.

For those that do know, Super Mario RPG is a pretty easy game once you master it.  It's one of the few RPGs that I've played where the \"Defense\" command is almost useless because of how powerful your equipment would get after a while and the fact that damage was pretty low-end, even for the stats that you had.  Also, I felt that the enemies and bosses, while having their fun gimmicks and quirks, were a step below that of the charm of the Mario & Luigi and Paper Mario (the earlier games, mind) series.\n\nThis ROM hack is a way to address those issues and to refine the game to challenge players that have played and beaten the original and wanted to experience this wonderful RPG in a new light.  All the enemies and bosses have had their battle scripts changed from scratch and any old strategies that you had for the bosses the first time around WILL not work as well as you'd think.  Also, characters have been re-balanced, so  that any character will be useful in your set-up and that the most powerful characters (Geno & Peach for example) aren't infinitely more useful than everyone else.  Equipment has been modified so that each piece of equipment will have some sort of use to you when you get it.  As there is the concern that when you get something like the Lazy Shell weapon in the original, the Ultra Hammer is deemed worthless because of it being incredibly weaker.  While the Lazy Shell weapon STILL is Mario's strongest weapon, it will certainly come with some consequences that will make you consider which is the best weapon.  Though, for those that like to be a little dissuaded by equipment lowering your stats, there generally is going to be a benefit that will make it arguably more useful than it appears.\n\nThe game also takes up the damage dealt between parties considerably more now, to accommodate for the higher stats and the fact that your characters can level up to 50!  It's just my way of saying, \"Man, level 30 is a odd level to max out on.  Let's raise the standard a bit.\"  While you certainly will not need the higher levels to be the game (on average, parties will typically be around Level 32~35 at the endgame), to take on the optional bosses, you're going to need all the help you can get!"},{"Name":"Super Mario Omega","Platform":"December 14, 2013","Release Date":"December 14, 2013","Game Type":"ROM Hack","Genres":"Platform","Description":"Princess Peach has once again been kidnapped by Bowser and this time he has taken her to the mysterious Gemtoa Region.

The goal of the game is to guide a bald and fun looking creature, who also happens to be a treasure hunter called Gussun (and his friend Oyoyo in two players mode), to the level's exit. This character just keeps walking around and gets scared at the silliest things. While he aimlessly wanders around the playfield, Tetris like pieces fall from the top of the screen, and the player must rotate and position them in the scene. Once in place, these blocks can be used by Gussun to climb on to reach new areas, and eventually lead him through the exit door. Tons of other features are also packed with the game, such as bombs or little buddies who follow Gussun to the exit (collect 10 of them for an extra life!).

Boy, you'd think that after being defeated four times prior that he would take a hint.  This time, you also get to face his five best soldiers, who will try to stop you in your tracks. To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air.  He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth.  As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity.  What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too.  This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you.  If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn).  Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl."},{"Name":"Super Game Boy 2","Platform":"January 30, 1998","Release Date":"January 30, 1998","Game Type":"Released","Developer":"Nintendo","Description":"The Super Game Boy 2 was released exclusively in Japan in 1998.

The goal of the former is to create combos and quickly eliminate sets to fill bases, which eventually leads to points on the table. The goal of the latter is to quickly eliminate sets so they can be the batting player again.

The game is a traditional platform game starring a character named Plok.\n\nPlok can launch any of his limbs at will to damage enemies. Once the damage has been done they return to Plok. Some puzzles involve having to \"sacrifice\" one of Plok's limbs to activate switches (thus gradually decreasing Plok's mobility and his chances in battle). Once a limb hits a switch, it is placed on a hanger that may be right next to the switch or several screens away; some switches also require certain limbs. Plok's secondary attack takes the form of a buzzsaw-like jump that not only gives him increased speed, but also dispatches enemies. Plok can pick up shells, which award extra lives and serve as ammunition for a special amulet received partway through the game. The amulet converts shells into power for Plok's secondary attack.\nPower-ups come in the form of \"presents\" scattered throughout the majority of levels. If Plok locates one of these colorful gifts he is immediately transformed into a more powerful fighting machine for a brief length of time. These power-ups include a flamethrower, boxing gloves, a blunderbuss, dueling pistols and multiple rocket launchers. Specific presents yield vehicles that Plok can use in some later levels in the fleas' lair such as a unicycle, Jeep, jetpack, motorbike, tank, helicopter, Flying saucer and a pair of spring pogo shoes.\nThe player encounters a number of different enemies, such as the aforementioned fleas."},{"Name":"Pit-Fighter","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","Release Date":"March 1, 1992","Game Type":"Released","Developer":"Atari Games","Genres":"Fighting","Description":"Venture deep into the hidden world of the under-city to battle the world's toughest brawlers!

You get Zelda at the beginning, but when you talk to your uncle, she disappeared. Some entrances were switched, which would result in false game play and all jumps diagonally-down would crash the game.\n\nYou can’t rescue Zelda since there is no staircase that leads to the priest, so the rain never stops and the palace guards did’t disappear. The game was again unsolvable.\n\nI have removed all mentioned bugs and have made new gameplay. Two dungeons were extended. There were also crash bugs inside the dungeons. All this was fixed.\n\nSometimes, the logic of the dungeon was false (some key doors were optional or there would be a key behind the key door).

Differences from this version and the last are pretty distinct. I corrected a fwe things, revised some lineups and rosters as well as rating the players differently so it would make a more evenly balanced game. \n\n \nFor my original release I used a player's 5 best career years, regardless of the team and regardless if the seasons were not in a row. While this may be more fun I suppose since players will be a lot better, it also made the game a little less balanced. So, for this release, I decided to take a player's 7 best seasons. Also, the 7 seasons had to be consecutive (except if they missed significant time due to injury or a suspension or military service) AND they had to be seasons from which the player played on the team he is represented on in the game. This helped make things a lot more balanced as well as making it a whole lot easier for me to rate the players. \n\n \nI also changed how I rated a player on their defense. I used a combination of Defensive Runs Saved, FLD%, Assists, dWAR, Caught Stealing % and Zone Ratings as well as taking Gold Gloves into account. This definitely lowered a lot of fielder ratings across the board and I think it's much more accurate. One good example of how this changed player ratings would be Jeter on the Yankees. His DEF rating is now a more realistic 7 since I now took into account his horrible range factor this time. Overall, I am a lot more happy with this version than the previous one and hopefully you are, too! I guess version 1.0 is more extreme, so you have a lot more guys rated 9 or 10 where as this one has far less players rated as highly. \n\n \nI included both the regular version here as well as the '98 expansion version, which replaces 2 teams so you can play as Tampa and Arizona if you want. (See the original v1.0 thread for details on that). \n\n \nEnjoy!\n\n \nFeel free to give any criticism or feedback and if you notice any mistakes. I had Harmon Killebrew as a Lefty in v1.0, but thanks to someone on here that pointed this error out, he is now a Righty like he should be."},{"Name":"Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","Release Date":"March 1, 1994","Game Type":"Released","Developer":"Software Creations Ltd.","Genres":"Sports","Description":"You can't beat the excitement of Major League Baseball and the magic of everyone's favorite All-Star hero, Ken Griffey Jr.!\n\nFrom power hitting to playing awesome defense, \"The Kid\" can do it all!

In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...\n\nGun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought.

When it was re-released for the Playstation, the graphics were uncensored but toned down script remained. Then came Final Fantasy VI Advance with a newer (though some consider drier) translation, but the color palette and music were altered for the handheld console. Others have made re-translations, such as the great work by RPGOne, Lina Darkstar, and Kwhazit.\n\nNow this is Final Fantasy VI: Ted Woolsey Uncensored Editon. The goal was to make the SNES version uncut and to clean up the script but keep the nuance used by Woolsey in the original game’s release. Using the original Woolsey script as a basis to analyze, the entire game was looked through, line by line, using FFVI Advance, RPGOne, and Lina Darkstar to accomplish this. Recently, the game’s script was also heavily analyzed by Kwhazit and Mato (Legends of Localization). With these newer and more heavily detailed looks into the game, the script was again updated to provide a much more accurate version while still remaining true to the original game’s release.\n\nAlso used was various tools and patches to uncensor the graphics, restore Character Class names, extend spell names, rename monsters and items, and make hopefully the version of Final Fantasy VI that everyone will play.\n\nAny bug fixes or additions that were used were chosen not for any balance changes, but to fix persistent issues in the game, as to not change the experience of the original too much. This even includes the long list used in the optional Bug-Fix versions of the game.\n\nAdditional Add-Ons are also optionally included. These tweaks bring an overall complete experience that many would say should have been in the original game to begin with.\n\nThe Music Player included with the game has been altered for compatibility with Ted Woolsey Uncensored Edition."},{"Name":"Final Fantasy VI: Brave New World","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","Release Date":"January 1, 2020","Game Type":"ROM Hack","Developer":"BTB","Genres":"Role-Playing","Description":"Final Fantasy VI: Brave New World is a ROM Hack and complete overhaul of the classic SNES adventure, featuring…\n\n• Character-based esper restrictions & new stat boosts that promote greater diversity and allow for customized development\n• Esper leveling system that disassociates esper bonuses from traditional levels\n• New and reworked formulas which rescue everything that isn’t magic or magic evasion from the dump-stat heap\n• Rebalanced equipment, items, spells, and skills that aim to remove dead weight and give players more (and better) choices\n• A complete overhaul of enemies from their stats to their behavior to better challenge veteran players and newcomers alike\n• Tons of bug fixes, as well as remedies to many of the game’s more annoying aspects (such as rage-hunting taking a lifetime)\n• And much, much more, detailed in the Readme (particularly section 4)"},{"Name":"Final Fantasy V","Platform":"December 6, 1992","Release Date":"December 6, 1992","Game Type":"Released","Developer":"Squaresoft","Genres":"Role-Playing","Description":"The Elemental Crystals...the life source of the planet.

It eventually was retooled and released on various 32 bit platforms as Grid Runner.\n\nThe game is basically a souped up version of childhood games of Tag and Capture the Flag. The game features a split-screen and is an ideal two player game.\n\nThe story behind the game is that the ruler of the galaxy decides that he will retire. In order to find a suitable replacement, he sets up a tournament where wizards and warriors compete to determine who shall be ruler. Throughout the game, you travel to many worlds across the galaxy to prove your might.\n\nThere are four characters to chose from at the start of the game. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses, based on their speed, spellcasting agility, and magic capacity. Through my playthrough, I used the average character.\n\nThe gameplay is very addictive, and relatively easy to get into. Basically, one of the characters starts off being \"it\". The person who is it cannot capture flags, so they must chase down the other character and touch them. Once you are not it, you can collect flags necessary to win the stage.\n\nComplicating the game is the obstacles you face. To proceed through the level, you basically have to build platforms. There are many levels with enemy creatures that usually require a number of blasts with your gun to kill. Speed tiles send you running really quickly, which can either make you quickly escape your foe, or send you far away from him.\n\nProbably the most compelling gameplay feature for experts is the magic system. Before each level, you learn a new magic spell. Some spells are mundane, like destroying a platform, but others can devastate your opponent, like the spell that causes all the creatures in the level to attack your opponent. Power-up balls throughout the level allow you to charge your magic meter.\n\nThe music is pretty typical \"sci-fi game\" fare, comparable to games like Blackthorne, B.O.B., and The Lost Vikings. The sound effects are somewhat muted, though the voice that tells you \"player 1 is now it\" is really well done. The graphics aren't anything too special, but they do the job."},{"Name":"ESPN Sunday Night NFL","Platform":"November 1, 1994","Release Date":"November 1, 1994","Game Type":"Released","Developer":"Ringler Studios","Genres":"Sports","Description":"ESPN Sunday Night NFL stands head and shoulder pads above the competition with incredible game play features and an end zone to end zone perspective.

Most of what I’ve changed is character names and the text, although I’ve also thrown in a few changes in the graphics I hope you’ll find to your liking. There is no “adult” content in this game unless you count a few items I’ve de-censored from Mother 2 that might get a mention on an Internet Movie Data Base parental guide but wouldn’t earn any movie so much as a PG rating (i.e. references to dating, death, and drugs).\n\nThis was originally a birthday gift for a young relative of mine who is about the same age as the protagonist and even looks a bit like her. While the game story will likely seem rather familiar from EarthBound, I’ve added several twists and put my own spin on things as you’ll see when you play it.

As he rushes out of bed and up to a nearby hill, he encounters a strange meteor, carrying a single passenger: a mysterious insect-like being named Buzz Buzz. Buzz Buzz tells him that in the future, an evil alien being known as Giygas has conquered the world, and the only one who can stop him are four young kids: three boys and a girl. Ness, of course, is one of the chosen ones, and he must find the other three children: Paula, a young girl with remarkable psychic powers, Jeff, a mechanical genius, and Poo, the young Prince of Dahlaam. Together, these four friends have the power to defeat Giygas and save the world from his chaotic reign!\n\nEarthBound is a sequel to Mother. It is a top-down role-playing game in which the heroes travel around Eagleland and various other, exotic countries, trying to end Giygas' evil influence.\n\nOn the way, Ness and his friends will encounter a lot of enemies and battle them in turn-based combat. Unlike in the previous game, enemies are visibly walking on the screen. Each turn, each of the characters in the party can attack with their weapons, use a special ability (some characters have powerful psychic powers that can hurt enemies, heal comrades and more; some also have some other, unique special powers), use an item or try and escape.\n\nThe game features \"rolling HP meters\" - when a character is dealt damage, it's not all taken away from his HP right away, but instead his HP decreases slowly; if the combat is ended quickly, even a massively damaging attack can leave a character with only minor injuries. By winning battles, characters receive experience and thus become stronger. If the player-controlled characters are strong enough, weak enemies will escape from them instead of trying to attack; when chased down, they will be defeated instantly.\n\nSaving the game is done by finding a telephone and calling Ness' father. When the heroes defeat enemies, Ness' bank account receives money, which can be then retrieved from ATM machines throughout the game and spent in shops to buy better equipment or useful items."},{"Name":"Earth Light: Luna Strike","Platform":"July 26, 1996","Release Date":"July 26, 1996","Game Type":"Released","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Genres":"Strategy","Description":"A turn-based strategy game from Hudson and a sequel to Earth Light.

A key part of the re-balance in this hack is making most Dual-Techs and Triple-Techs significantly stronger than in the original game, compared to Single Techs.\n\nSummary of Changes:\n\n-Entire game made substantially more difficult. Usually not so much as to require substantial grind. By end-game, having max of certain defensive stats is necessary, and is also achievable long before reaching max level.\n\n- Particular detail has been given to end-game bosses and enemies, often involving extensive changes of their battle scripts.\n\n- Running from battles, is no longer possible.\n\n- From Death's Peak onward, enemies give substantially increased XP compared to the original game, in order to speed-up the end-game leveling process.\n\n- Dual- and Triple-Tech power generally improved.\n\n- Some re-balancing of endgame skills, especially: Luminaire, Flare, Dark Matter, Shock, and Dark Bomb, but others as well.\n\n- General re-balance of characters, but staying within their given themes.\n\n- End-game equipment has been partially re-designed with new stats and effects in the interest of balance and providing more complex equipment setups.\n\n- Once you have the winged Epoch, no one-time-fight-able enemies from that point forward, will have unique charm-able items -- WITH THE EXCEPTION OF OZZIE'S FORT. This frees the player from having to include Ayla in a great many boss fights. Typically, the bosses now drop their charm-able item instead, if it was something special.\n\n- Special Uber-Boss: Nu Spekkio is now 10x the force he was in the original game. Try him out if you're looking for a battle potentially even more epic than the final battle.\n\n- Easter Egg: Lucca's Pico Magnum can be found somewhere in the game, but it's rather annoying to acquire. It's a good weapon for her when you get it, but mostly, it's just a trophy.\n\n- Lapis item now heals for 350, instead of 200.\n\n- Megalixirs, can now only be used on the field."},{"Name":"Chrono Trigger: Flames of Eternity","Platform":"October 18, 2010","Release Date":"October 18, 2010","Game Type":"ROM Hack","Developer":"The Metronome Project","Genres":"Role-Playing","Description":"The ULTIMATE Chrono Trigger hack!

Instead of pairing and removing any two tiles that match as long as one of their sides is clear, as is the case in Shanghai, the rules of Chinhai require that the two tiles can only be removed if it's possible to draw a line between the two that doesn't make a 90 degree turn more than twice. Two tiles on opposite sides of the board, for instance, can't be paired because it would take three 90 degree turns to draw a line between them. To account for this added difficulty, the game lacks the \"stacks\" of tiles that frequently appear in Shanghai, instead presenting a flat board of tiles.\n\nChinhai is named for the municipality of Chinhai in China, maintaining the theme of naming mahjong solitaire variants after territories in China.

Over the course of three years, I brought the mechanics, elements, and visuals from Celeste into Super Mario World. While the inspiration comes heavily from Celeste, it is not a 1:1 recreation or remake of it. The level design is entirely my own, blending the ideologies from Kaizo Mario and Celeste into one complete package. The overarching level design philosophy is something that has never really been seen before given the hack's extensive catalog of custom mechanics and its use of exploration despite being considered Kaizo.\nBasically every mechanic from Celeste you can think of has been brought over. The dash, the wall jump, the strawberries, and more. Nearly everything has some form of representation in the hack and it is all combined with familiar SMW and Kaizo mechanics. Regrabs, neutralling of the d-pad, and of course shells are all utilized in combination with the Celeste elements to create a one-of-a-kind hack playthrough.\nWith these being said, I do have a few warnings. If you have not beaten all chapters of Celeste, I would recommend doing that before playing this. This hack does its best to explain the Celeste mechanics, though a base understanding of how they work in the original game is quite useful to have in the back pocket. It will also highlight some of the minute differences between Celeste and my implementation of them in the SMW engine.\nAnother warning is that this hack is fairly difficult. I did my best to make (at least) the first level approachable for beginners so they could at least enjoy some of this game, but the difficulty ramps dramatically as the hack progresses. This game assumes that you have a strong, fundamental understanding of Kaizo mechanics and if you lack these, this hack may be something you approach at a later point in time. I would consider beating Summit (\"any%\") a Kaizo: Intermediate hack, but going for a full 100% completion (all berries, all hearts, all chapters) would be Kaizo: Expert.\nThe last warning I'll mention (in regards to the hack's difficulty and gameplay) is that this hack is incredibly rough on the hands. Especially when playing on a standard SNES controller, your hands will hurt more quickly than playing a typical Kaizo hack due to the custom mechanics this hack features. I would recommend taking breaks when playing through this, both to save your hands and to enjoy the experience more. Getting stuck on sections when your hands hurt or when something is unclear is a good time to stop. It will play much better the next time you tackle it. Feel free to ignore my advice, just be aware of the potential consequences.\nLast note, and this is mainly for stating compatibility. To start, this hack does not work on SNES Classic, and will never work for it. Due to all the custom stuff that gets saved and the system's improper emulation of SRAM, this hack will not work on SNES Classic and I would have to rewrite basically everything to make it compatible. Sorry, play on an emulator instead. The other incompatible thing is that using savestates on console can be quite buggy. Due to how savestates work on console versus emulators, anything in SRAM will not get saved properly and may result in unintended consequences. I also have custom audio code and due to how ARAM is not backed up on console savestates, audio may break as well in levels that run this specified code. While I have code that could prevent savestate use entirely, you can still try to use savestates on console, but I am giving you plenty of warning that it might not work as you expect.\nAnyway, with all of that said, I am incredibly happy to finally be putting this out. This hack means a lot to me and I hope you have as much fun playing it as I did making it. If you actually read through the entirety of this description, you're a real one. Good luck, have fun.\n\nYou can do this."},{"Name":"CB Chara Wars: Ushinawareta Gag","Platform":"August 28, 1992","Release Date":"August 28, 1992","Game Type":"Released","Developer":"Almanic","Genres":"Action","Description":"CB Chara Wars: Ushinawareta Gag is an action game that features a crossover of sorts of Go Nagai's various manga franchises.

Long time ago, the first deity, the Emperor of Light, created two gods - from the darkness, the Ocean God, and from the glittering moon, the Mountain Goddess - and sent them to build a world out of the chaos. The Ocean God poured rain over the chaos and created seas and oceans; the Mountain Goddess created the Earth. But the Ocean God became evil. He built a huge tower, which connected Earth and Heaven, and thus the world of men and the world of gods became merged, and the path for demons to invade the Earth was open.\n\nSomewhere on an island called Mamoshima, there lives a young warrior apprentice called Jin. One day he goes to the nearby village, but when he returns, he finds his house has been burnt down by demons, and his sister kidnapped. Remembering the tale of the Ocean God his sister told him when he was a child, Jin realizes he has to find a way to the tower of the Ocean God in order to free his sister.

Operation Barbarossa (German: Unternehmen Barbarossa) was the code name for Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II, which began on 22 June 1941. The operation was driven by Adolf Hitler's ideological desire to conquer the Soviet territories as outlined in his 1925 manifesto Mein Kampf (\"My Struggle\").\nIn the two years leading up to the invasion, the two countries signed political and economic pacts for strategic purposes. Still, on 18 December 1940, Hitler authorized an invasion of the Soviet Union for a start date of 15 May 1941, but this was not met; instead, the invasion began on 22 June 1941. Over the course of the operation, about four million soldiers of the Axis powers invaded the Soviet Union along a 2,900-kilometer (1,800 mi) front, the largest invasion force in the history of warfare. In addition to troops, the Germans employed some 600,000 motor vehicles and between 600–700,000 horses.

Various power-ups may appear after destructible blocks are removed, which can give the player an edge or, in the case of the ? icon, a possible random negative effect like reversed controls.

Japan, controlled by the feudal rulers (shoguns) of the Tokugawa dynasty, consumed by a peaceful sleep for three hundred years, was awoken by the arrival of the Westerners. It seemed that they only wanted the end of Japan's isolation from the rest of the world. But their true purpose was to take control of a mysterious Japanese energy source called reiketsu. To protect those sources, that were running dry during their three hundred years-long reign, the Tokugawa Shoguns formed the famous Shinsengumi special force. In addition to its primary mission of clearing out forces that would try to overthrow the shogunate, there also existed a special branch of them called \"Shadow Shinsengumi\". The duty of the \"Shadow\" was to take care of \"those things the human hand cannot manage\"...\n\nYou control Yamatomaru, a strong-willed sixteen-year-old boy who lives in Iida village, near Koufu. His father has recently passed away. After failing to defeat a monster in his village, he was saved by one of the Shadow Shinsengumi man, Mibu Juurota. As he receives his father's katana, he goes on his first mission - rescuing boys who were trapped in a mountain path. Soon the plot thickens and the young hero becomes involved in mystical struggles between the forces who try to control reiketsu...\n\nThe gameplay is similar to Dragon Quest series and other Japanese-style RPGs: the battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. You fight using physical attacks and a variety of special moves based on spiritual energy. An unusual addition to the gameplay is the karma system. By doing good deeds you can increase your karma level, in an Ultima-like way. This way you get more money and precious items from fighting monsters, and your special powers increase in strength. If you don't show compassion, steal people's things and lie, your karma will decrease, you won't get money from random battles, and some people will attack you."},{"Name":"Bakukyuu Renpatsu!!

Characters have HP, MP (SP for fighter characters), EXP, equipment, stats and class-specific, SP-draining special elemental abilities very much like traditional console RPGs. The player can explore his surroundings, talk to people and visit shops when not in battle, though to a limited degree as there is no world map and no way to leave the current area.\n\nThe game's core is its turn-based battles fought on a 2d grid. Characters are assembled into parties of four and the player allowed a maximum of six parties, which are usually well outnumbered. The two opposing sides act in alternating turns so that each party can move once and\/or attack once a turn. Attacks are divided into distant and close-up combat. In the former, a party uses a special ability (e.g. casting fireballs, throwing lightning, healing allies) of one of its members at a distance. The range and possible area of effect damage vary per ability. If the attacking party has two or more characters with the same ability, they join in the action to multiply its effectiveness. Distant combat results in less money and generally less damage, but the target cannot retaliate. Distant attacks can also affect the field; fire and ice ignite or extinguish forests and melt or freeze ice, etc. Close-up, each unit in two adjacent opposing parties can act once. Very much like Final Fantasy SNES combat, they can attack an enemy, use an item or a special ability (though these can't be combined and most only affect one target instead of all) or defend.\n\nDragons are the player's ace in the hole. They have their own stats and gain experience like normal characters do. In battle, each party has a dragon attached to it and draws a large portion of its strength from that of its dragon: if a party's dragon is slain, the party will lose the ability to use special attacks and class-specific abilities for the remainder of the map. The beast acts as a very powerful autonomous unit that moves after its party does and it cannot be controlled beyond very simple commands, e.g. \"Come!\" Out of battle, dragons will eat anything and raising them by feeding them items is an important part of the game. Feeding can improve their stats as well as affect their behavior on the field, and the dragons develop into new forms as they grow.\n\nThe player can change the characters in each of the parties, their formation as well as what dragon represents them at will."},{"Name":"Bad Apple!!","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","Release Date":"August 26, 2016","Game Type":"Homebrew","Developer":"Ladida","Genres":"Music","Description":"I made a Bad Apple SNES demo last year that ran at 30fps, and one of the things I did was only decompressing tiles that have details."},{"Name":"Baby Kaizo World","Platform":"February 19, 2019","Release Date":"February 19, 2019","Game Type":"ROM Hack","Developer":"Nowieso","Genres":"Platform","Description":"Dear Baby,\nI made this hack for you so you can practice Kaizo tricks\nin easy, short and forgiving levels.

Now, without warning, a mechanical moon has appeared in the skies over Mars, and is raining down destruction on the colonies. A plan is hastily put into action to destroy the moon and its armada of space-craft. Due to the impossible task of surviving a direct assault, the mission is code-named Acrobat Mission.\n\nYour spaceship in Acrobat Mission is capable of firing a single straight ahead shot. By picking up a Wide upgrade, more shots are added that fly off at an angle, and the shot can be charged up to unleash a continuous short range cone of energy. Picking up a Hurricane upgrade will cause bullets to circle you defensively before shooting forward, and charging will store a full round of bullets up to be fired straight ahead all at once. Up to two bombs can be held at once, and if an enemy bullet hits a bomb it will detonate, saving your ship from damage. If your ship is hit, however, then you will have a few seconds to ram it into whatever shot you and take them down with you. Unlike most scrolling shooter games contact with an enemy ship will not kill you, but they can still push you into the path of bullets.\n\nPlay takes place over five levels, first of your launch on Mars, then the approach to the moon, and finally infiltrating the base to destroy its core.
