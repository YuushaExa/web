          <name>1941: Counter Attack (World 900227) </name>
          <desc>1941 Counter Attack is a vertical shooter by Capcom and conversion of the arcade game of the same name originally released in 1990. The action takes place during World War II and depicts Capcom&#39;s own fantastic vision of the historic battle between the American and Japanese air forces in the Pacific. The player&#39;s mission is rather straightforward - on board a Lockheed P-38 airplane, he must fight his way through six varied stages, take down enemy installations, battleships and other huge rockets on their narrow launching pads. Unlike its predecessors in the series, 1941 Counter Attack traded the trademark and arguably monotonous level design for a more structured and diverse formula. Stages vary from an enemy infested canyon to city landscapes and fortified strongholds. Several powerups can be collected along the way, such as tiny wingmen widening the plane&#39;s fire power, or destructive special weapons such as laser beams and side rockets. The main weapon can also be charged up by holding the fire button to discharge a powerful attack. Finally, the plane comes with a small life bar and can be hit three time before being blasted into oblivion - this bar however increases as the game progresses, and is used to release devastating special attacks as well. 1941 Counter Attack also features a two simultaneous player mode.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>There is no longer conventional baseball in 2020. The Super Baseball designed by the SUPER BASEBALL ASSOCIATION has been very popular and is the best sport. However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player&#39;s ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball.&#xA;&#xA;Finally, a fair game in going to be played at &#34;CYBER EGG&#34;!&#xA;&#xA;FUTURISTIC SUPER BASEBALL, NOW PLAY BALL!&#xA;&#xA;2020 Super Baseball:&#xA;1.

The Super Baseball Association has been very profitable over the years with robotics power players up against the strongest of athletes. Due to the secret manipulation of certain robotics team players, abilities have been computer controlled to decide the outcome of certain games, benefiting the SBA. Die hard players discovered the SBA&#39;s cheating and have now disconnected several parts of the computers to achieve fair and challenging play. Now the games may continue in the famed Cyber-Egg Stadium where only power and skill will determine the winner!&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>Strap yourself into the cockpit and squeeze off heat-seeking missiles in this grittily realistic jet-fighter shooter. &#xA;&#xA;Sinister forces have melted the Antarctic ice cap, flooding the earth&#39;s cities. No one knows where they came from or what they want. But when the mysterious invaders attack Tokyo, you&#39;re called to lead an elite international team of pilots into the incredibly wild blue yonder!&#xA;&#xA;In single-player mode, AeroFighters Assault features eight primary and four bonus missions. The game features four aircraft, plus two bonus fighters. Your enemies come at you in jet fighters, helicopters, submarines and frigates, guaranteeing endless wing time as you blow away aliens bent on world conquest. There are giant bosses, too! &#xA;&#xA;The action takes place over cities, oceans dotted with icebergs and parched desert. For pure flying fun, Multiplayer mode features a sky stage in which you run absolutely no risk of running into the ground. AeroFighters Assault supports full 360-degree action by allowing you to switch among multiple camera views at any time. &#xA;&#xA;The product of an unprecedented partnership between arcade specialist Video System and the flight sim masters at Paradigm Entertainment, AeroFighters expands on the traditional shooter by adding plenty of authentic touches. The Paradigm team logged plenty of wing time crafting high-tech flight sims for military pilots before helping Shigeru Miyamoto and his NCL team develop Pilotwings 64. With experience like that, AeroFighters is a first-rate flight sim, complete with a stunning flight-physics model and dazzling acrobatic moves.&#xA;&#xA;A savvy veteran of the arcade wars, Video Systems made sure to pack AeroFighters Assault with white-knuckle action, especially when you&#39;re dogfighting a buddy in two-player mode.&#xA;&#xA;Redrawing the intricately detailed fighters at supersonic speeds would tax most game systems, but the powerful N64 never misses a beat. The Controller&#39;s analog Control Stick gives you pin-point control as you bank, roll and plunge into screaming dives after your high-powered enemies.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>An overhead driving / shoot&#39;em up game from Sega which borrows heavily from Bally Midway&#39;s 1983 classic, &#34;Spy Hunter&#34;. The player begins the game riding a motorbike. In subsequent levels a sportscar, a beach buggy, a boat, a chopper and even a Formula-1 racing car can all be driven. All of the vehicles are, of course, fully armed to deal with the many enemy vehicles and gun emplacements intent on stopping the player&#39;s progress. The helicopter levels play as a straightforward vertically-scrolling shoot&#39;em up and bear more than a passing resemblance to Namco&#39;s &#34;Xevious&#34;.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>1-on-1 fighter featuring 8 selectable characters.&#xA;&#xA;The game&#39;s major innovation is the ability to walk into the background, in a similar manner to side-scrolling beat &#39;em ups such as &#34;Streets of Rage&#34; or &#34;Final Fight&#34; because of this, unlike many other 2-D fighting games, the game uses one action button to jump, it also does not use the &#39;D&#39; button, (Which many of SNK&#39;s other fighters did), only 2 action buttons are used for attacking (punch and kick), instead grappling and grabbing opponents (Pressing the A &amp; B buttons simultaneously) is the focus of the gameplay, opponents can counter being grabbed, as well as break free. Also featured is weapon play, again similar to beat &#39;em ups, weapons can be picked up and thrown, or used in special &amp; standard attacks. Weapons are thrown in by background crowd members who will step forward to toss them into the ring. Another (strange) innovation of the game is that characters start to sweat -graphically- after a while.&#xA;&#xA;Characters have unusually high health for the genre, with multiple, different coloured, health bars in one bar similar to a method of health bars used for boss characters in games of the time, in addition to this, each character has a &#39;Crazy Meter&#39; at the bottom of the screen, which is built up as characters attack, this gives the character a special, often very bizarre, attack that will kill the opponent outright, known as the GanGan Attack in Japan, and the Crazy Attack in the US.&#xA;&#xA;Battles are joined by irreverent, sometimes humorous pre-fight banter from characters, the dialog differs depending on whom each opponent is, and a clashing of 2 small images of the characters eyes, which clash in the center of the screen.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Area 88 (Japan) </name>
          <desc>Area 88 is a side scrolling shooter by Capcom, conversion of their own arcade game originally. An evil general and his army are taking over the world and they must be stopped. A group of three highly skilled mercenary pilots who blow things up for cash, Shin Kazama, Mickey Scymon and Greg Gates, accept the mission readily. On board of their aircrafts they&#39;re now ready to defeat the greedy dictator and restore peace. One of the distinctive feature of the game is the ability given to the player to purchase new weapons and fighter planes. Right from the start, pilots are offered a F8E Crusader fighter and some cash. Then after each mission, the earned cash can be used to purchase new weapons or a brand new fighter giving the player a sense of customization. But there is a catch and special weapons and cash are lost if the player happens to die during a mission. Each pilot also comes with his own specialty - Shin, the young hero pilot, can level up the standard plane&#39;s Vulcan gun faster than his friends, Mickey, the hot-shot, can carry more special weapons and Greg, the veteran, has more health and can recover faster from injuries. The game is vast and offers not less than ten intense stages. It is however one player only.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>The player takes control of a boy who must use his hammer to break the blocks that form part of the colourful, platform-strewn levels that form each stage. These holes act as traps for the many patrolling monsters and once an enemy has fallen into a hole, the player must then use the hammer on the enemy to make it fall through the hole and down to the platform below - causing it to change into fruit, which can then be collected. This game is a reworking of the 1980 classic, &#34;Space Panic&#34;.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Biomechanical Toy (Ver. 1.0.1885) </name>
          <desc>Biomechanical Toy is a colourful eightway-scrolling platform game set in a world of magically animated toys. The magical pendulum that animates the toys has been stolen by the evil &#39;Scrubby&#39; - a criminal once imprisoned for trying to steal the pendulum who has managed to escape and take his revenge.&#xA;&#xA;Evil toys now patrol the kingdom and must be destroyed or avoided. Good toys have been trapped throughout the levels and if freed by Inguz, will give help by providing additional firepower for a short time.&#xA;&#xA;Inguz carries a basic, single-firing gun, although additional ammo clips can be found throughout the game that upgrade the gun with either extra shot power, automatic firing or exploding bullets. When the gun&#39;s current ammo clip is empty, Inguz will take a moment to reload, leaving him vulnerable to attack.&#xA;&#xA;Inguz begins each stage (and each new life) with a full health meter of eighty units, but food can be found that will boost the health meter. The player can lose a life either by running out of health, falling off the bottom of the screen, or running out of time. Clearing each stage awards bonus points based on both remaining time and health units.&#xA;&#xA;Checkpoints - indicated by red flags - are located at certain points throughout the stages. In the event of losing a life, the player will restart at the last checkpoint reached. Objects with Inguz&#39;s face on them (such as wooden chests and balloons) release bonus items when shot.&#xA;&#xA;An abstract, oriental-looking face occasionally forms part of a level&#39;s platform which, when shot, releases balloons which can in turn be shot for bonus items. A giant flying hat also occasionally appears and will drop bonus items when shot. Smart Bombs can also be found at certain points that, when run into by Inguz, will damage or destroy all enemy toys on screen.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Blue&#39;s Journey / Raguy (ALM-001)(ALH-001) </name>
          <desc>Raguy is an environmentally-themed side-scrolling platform game for one or two players. &#xA;&#xA;The player controls a heroic young man named &#39;Blue&#39; (in the two-player game the second player controls &#39;Princess Fa&#39;, who has identical powers to Blue), whose peaceful home planet of &#39;Raguy&#39; has been invaded by the evil Daruma tribe. The Daruma are polluting the planet as they consume its dwindling resources and it falls on Blue and the Princess to stop them and save Raguy. &#xA;&#xA;Both Blue and Princess Fa have the ability to stun enemies by hitting them with a large leaf. Once stunned, they can be picked up and thrown as projectiles at other enemies. Blue and Princess Fa can also shrink in size in order to access hidden areas, but they are not able to stun enemies while shrunk. If only one player is shrunk, they can be picked up by the other player and thrown as a projectile at the enemies. &#xA;&#xA;Flowers, bonus items and power-ups are littered throughout the levels. The flowers are the game&#39;s form of currency and can be used in the shops that are located throughout the game. There are two different types of shop, offering either tips and help with overcoming certain obstacles, or health and weapon power-ups.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>An adult shanghai game from Mitchell. The objective is to clear the board of matching tiles before the timer runs out.&#xA;&#xA;Each level consists a board with two or more columns of tiles and walls slowly moving toward the center of the board.  Every time a matching pair of tiles is cleared from the board the two columns momentarily shift away from the center. The game is lost if the opposing columns of tiles run into each other or into the wall. In order to legally remove matching tiles no walls or other tiles can be in a path with two or fewer bends between the matching tiles. Once per stage, the player can request help and the two columns will shift to their starting positions and matching tiles will be highlighted for a short time. If the player cannot legally remove any more tiles then the board is &#39;deadlocked&#39;, and the game is lost.&#xA;&#xA;If the player clears the board before the timer runs out, the background girl will change into a more revealing state of undress and this new image of her will be the background for the next stage.  If the timer reaches zero the player can still attempt to clear the board but the background image will not change.  The game features four girls with two background images each and a topless image that is revealed after defeating the girl&#39;s second stage within the time limit. &#xA;If the game is lost, upon continuing the player may select to attempt to clear the same board or try a new board of tiles.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>Cyber-Lip is a platform shoot-em-up for one or two players that borrows heavily from Konami&#39;s &#34;Contra&#34; series. Players must battle through sideways-scrolling levels, to defeat armies of cyborgs and androids and restore order and peace to the world.&#xA;&#xA;Cyber-Lip has two shooting modes, one for standard weapon use and one for rocket launchers and grenade throwing. Players can switch between the two modes at any time, but only carry a limited amount of grenades or rockets. Weapon power-ups and additional grenades and rockets can be picked up throughout the levels.&#xA;&#xA;At the end of certain levels, the game&#39;s heroes will enter an elevator and players can then choose whether to go &#39;up&#39; or &#39;down&#39;, depending on which route through the game they wish to take. Each level has a large end-of-level boss that must be defeated.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Daimakaimura (Japan) </name>
          <desc>Daimakaimura is a platform game by Capcom and is the SuperGrafx port of the classic arcade game known outside of Japan as Ghouls&#39;n Ghosts. The brave Arthur, infamous for wearing red hearted boxers under his piece of armor, is back. His beloved princess Prin-Prin has been captured by the great demon king Loki and he has now, once again, the daunting task of rescuing her. His journey gets him through six long stages from a creepy cemetery infested with Grim Reapers and Vultures, to a abandoned windmills full of deadly stone turtles. Arthur starts the game equipped with a short joust spear that he can throw at his enemies. Treasure chests appear from time to time (usually triggered by jumping over specific spots of the scenery) and Arthur can crack them open to reveal new weapons, brand new piece of armors or, if already equipped with one, the almighty Golden Armor. But treasure chests can also reveal mean sorcerers who won&#39;t hesitate to turn our hero into an elderly man with a walking stick, or a cute but particularly vulnerable duck. Finally, the Golden Armor can be charged up and unleash powerful attacks from the equipped weapon. For instance, the spear can trigger a lighting spell and daggers a mirror-image of Arthur. The game is vast and mean guardians keep the gates leading to Loki&#39;s lair.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>Dai Sen Puu is a vertical shooter, conversion of Toaplan/Taito&#39;s arcade game originally released back in 1989. The player controls a World War II fighter plane and must fly deep into enemy lines and destroy formations of tanks and other warships. Small trucks sometimes appear and release bonuses when shot: P (power ups), H (extra bomb) or flashing planes (extra life). A group of six planes can also be called to fly next to our fighter and shoot anything in sight. Pressing the bomb button twice drop a powerful bomb that cleans up a fair amount of the screen. Finally, Dai Sen Puu offers an unusual feature : levels do not pause between them and uncover instead a continuous flow of undisturbed shooting action.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Dynamite Dux (set 1, 8751 317-0095) </name>
          <desc>An abstract and hugely entertaining take on the classic sideways scrooling beat-em-up genre for one or two players; in which two blue and red pet ducks called &#39;Bin&#39; and &#39;Pin&#39; take on a variety of bizarre enemies - such as disembodied moose heads and mortar-using wolves - in their quest to rescue their kidnapped owner, Lucy.&#xA;&#xA;The ducks have a powerful punch which can be &#39;charged-up&#39; by holding down the button, in a similar fashion to the beam weapon in Irem&#39;s &#34;R*Type&#34;. In addition, extra weapons such as rocket launchers and bombs can be picked up along the way.&#xA;&#xA;There are also two bonus stages (which appear after levels 2 and 4). In these stages player one fights against player two. The winner is awarded 100,000 points. If the time limit expires before the fight is settled, the player with the most energy is awarded 50,000 points.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Dangan Feveron (Japan, Ver. 98/09/17) </name>
          <desc>A vertically scrolling shoot-em-up from the undisputed masters of the genre, &#39;Cave&#39;, Dangun Feveron features the usual Cave trademarks of intuitive, power-up driven gameplay backed-up with superb graphics and sound.&#xA;&#xA;Dangun Feveron features a very high level of player customisation. At the start of a new game, players are prompted to select 3 different ship attributes; the speed of ship they wish to pilot (from a choice of four), which of the 3 rapid-fire weapons they prefer, and their preferred choice of sustained-fire weapons (activated by holding down the FIRE button). This allows players to tailor the ship to suit their individual needs and gameplay styles, be it a fast-flying speeder with widespread shots to handle enemy squadrons, or a ship with a lower speed that makes it easier to negotiate the swathes of enemy bullets that often fill the screen.&#xA;&#xA;Another of the game&#39;s selling points is the capture-and-score system. Initially, every enemy destroyed is worth only one point. However, whenever an enemy is destroyed, coloured spheres appear in its wake, each containing a trapped, human prisoner. The spheres can then be collected by the player to earn additional points. For each prisoner saved, the total points gained from each enemy killed increases by one. For example, saving 56 prisoners means every subsequent defeated enemy is worth fifty-seven points. When the spheres appear, they drift slowly towards the bottom of the screen, before moving back up towards the top where, if they are not collected in time, they drift out of the screen and beyond the player&#39;s reach. This resets enemy-destroyed score back to a single point per enemy. If the player loses all of their lives and chooses to &#39;Continue&#39; the game, the rescue count is reset to zero.&#xA;&#xA;Dangun Feveron&#39;s final distinction was in its use of music and sound effects, with the game&#39;s creators drawing heavily on the disco sound of the 1970s.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

Like &#34;Qix&#34; and its sequels, Fantasia&#39;s levels are populated with a number of enemies who must be avoided or destroyed. As well as the enemies, players are also fighting against a tight time limit.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>Final Fight is a side scrolling beat&#39;m up and is the conversion by Capcom of their own arcade game originally released in 1989. The game features two playable characters - the heavy built but slow former champion wrestler Mike Haggar and the more agile and fast martial art expert Joe Cody. Here is the first difference that would strike players used to the arcade game - the third character from the original game, Guy, is nowhere to be seen. The Mad Gears gang has taken over Metro city and has kidnapped the daughter of the newly elected mayor, Mike Haggar. Jessica also happens to be Cody&#39;s girlfriend and our two heroes must fight their way through the city, beat-up dozens and dozens of vile gang members and finally take down the evil Belger, their murderous leader. Levels are built around locked-in sections, in which all opponents must be defeated to continue. The game also includes several bonus stages such as a fun car-breaking exercise with an iron pipe. Each fighter can use simple fighting moves such as punches, jumps and pressing punch rapidly triggers powerful combos. They can also grab and throw, or hold on and hit their enemies. Finally, each fighter comes with a special attack when punch and jump are pressed simultaneously - this move drains some of their health energy but allows them to safely escape desperate situations. This Super Famicom port is a cut-down version of the original arcade game, the two players mode is gone as well as the fourth factory/Industrial stage.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>
